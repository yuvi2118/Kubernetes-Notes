## Docker vs Kubernetes

### Docker
- Containerization technology that packages applications with their dependencies
- Provides lightweight, portable runtime environments
- Focuses on running individual containers
- Limited orchestration capabilities

### Kubernetes (K8s)
- Container orchestration platform
- Manages, scales, and deploys containerized applications
- Provides advanced features like:
  - Automatic scaling
  - Self-healing
  - Load balancing
  - Rolling updates
  - Service discovery

## Kubernetes Architecture

### Control Plane Components
- **kube-apiserver**: Central control hub for all cluster operations
- **etcd**: Distributed key-value store for cluster state
- **kube-scheduler**: Decides pod placement on nodes
- **kube-controller-manager**: Manages cluster state and controllers
- **cloud-controller-manager**: Interacts with cloud provider APIs

### Worker Node Components
- **kubelet**: Ensures containers are running in pods
- **kube-proxy**: Network proxy and load balancer
- **Container Runtime**: (Docker, containerd, CRI-O)

## Fundamental Concepts

### Pods
- Smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes
- Can contain one or multiple containers
- Shared network namespace
- Ephemeral by nature
- Assigned unique IP address within cluster

### Deployment Strategies
- **Recreate**: Terminate all old pods before creating new ones
- **Rolling Update**: Gradually replace pods with zero downtime
- **Blue-Green Deployment**: Switch traffic between two identical environments
- **Canary Deployment**: Gradually route traffic to new version

## Services and Networking

### Service Types
- **ClusterIP**: Internal cluster communication
- **NodePort**: Exposes service on static port across cluster
- **LoadBalancer**: External load balancing
- **ExternalName**: Maps service to external DNS name

### Ingress
- HTTP/HTTPS routing
- SSL termination
- Path-based routing
- Hostname-based routing
- Supports external load balancers

## Security (RBAC - Role-Based Access Control)

### Authentication Methods
- X.509 Certificates
- Static Token File
- Bootstrap Tokens
- Service Account Tokens
- OpenID Connect
- Webhook Token Authentication

### Authorization
- **Role**: Defines permissions within a namespace
- **ClusterRole**: Defines cluster-wide permissions
- **RoleBinding**: Connects roles to users/groups
- **ClusterRoleBinding**: Connects cluster roles to users/groups

## State Management

### Persistent Volumes (PV)
- Storage abstraction
- Independent of pod lifecycle
- Supports various storage types
- Access modes:
  - ReadWriteOnce
  - ReadOnlyMany
  - ReadWriteMany

### StatefulSets
- Stable, unique network identifiers
- Stable, persistent storage
- Ordered, graceful deployment and scaling
- Ideal for stateful applications

## Production Readiness Checklist

### Cluster Configuration
- Multi-master setup
- High availability
- Proper resource allocation
- Network policies
- Cluster autoscaling

### Application Design
- Stateless applications preferred
- Health checks and probes
- Resource limits and requests
- Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)

### Monitoring and Logging
- Prometheus for metrics
- ELK stack for logging
- Distributed tracing
- Alerting mechanisms

### Security Best Practices
- Network policies
- Pod security policies
- Secrets management
- Regular security audits
- Minimal container images

### Backup and Disaster Recovery
- etcd backup strategy
- Persistent volume snapshots
- Cluster state recovery
- Multi-region deployment

### Performance Optimization
- Efficient resource utilization
- Caching strategies
- Connection pooling
- Vertical and horizontal scaling

### Continuous Deployment
- GitOps workflows
- Helm charts
- Kustomize
- ArgoCD / FluxCD

## Advanced Topics
- Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)
- Operators
- Service Mesh (Istio)
- Serverless Kubernetes
- Multi-cluster management

## Recommended Tools
